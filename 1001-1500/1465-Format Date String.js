/*
Format Date String

Create a function that takes a date object and return string in the following format:

YYYYMMDDHHmmSS

The format should contain a 4 digit year, 2 digit month, 2 digit day, 2 digit hour(00-23), 2 digit minute and 2 digit second. If any of the value has only signle digit, you must use zero prefix, so that the result string length is always same.

Examples
formatDate(new Date(2020, 6, 4, 8, 0, 0)) ➞ "20200704080000"

formatDate(new Date(2019, 11, 31, 23, 59, 59)) ➞ "20191231235959"

formatDate(new Date(2020, 6, 4)) ➞ "20200704000000"
Notes
Assume Date year input will always be greater than 1970.
Try not to rely on default Date.toString() output in your impelementation.
Be aware that the Date's month field is zero based (0 is January and 11 is December).
