Recursion: Sort and Find

In this challenge, we'll take recursion to the next level, where we will embed a recursive function within a recursive function.

Write a function that sorts the strings in an array (if the string is a palindrome, it will become part of the sorted array) and finds the longest non-palindromic string.

Although these tasks are achievable with the use of some built-in Array functions, the purpose and intent of this challenge is for you to solve it recursively.

Output Structure
{longest: longest_non_palindromic, length: longest_length, palindromes: [...palindromic_strings]}
Examples
qualify(["wow", "relevance", "radar", "soundly", "intelligence", "racecar", "gradually"]) ➞ {"longest": "intelligence", "length": 12, "palindromes": ["racecar", "radar", "wow"]}

qualify(["persistence", "anna", "civic", "perseverance", "kayak", "irrefutability"]) ➞ {"longest": "irrefutability", "length": 14, "palindromes": ["anna", "civic", "kayak"]}

qualify(["level", "resistance", "madam", "arrogance", "unconsiderably", "mom", "noon"]) ➞ {"longest": "unconsiderably", "length": 14, "palindromes": ["level", "madam", "mom", "noon"]}
Notes
All items in the array are lowercase.
In cases where two longest words are found, return the first.
The use of reduce(), reduceRight(), map(), filter(), indexOf() and max() functions are restricted.
You can read more about recursion (see Resources tab) if you aren't familiar with it yet or haven't fully understood the concept before taking up this challenge.
