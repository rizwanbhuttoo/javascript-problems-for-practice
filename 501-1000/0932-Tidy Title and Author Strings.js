Tidy Title and Author Strings

You have an array of strings, each consisting of a book title and an author's name.

To illustrate:

[
  ["   Death of a Salesman - Arthur Miller    "],
  ["   Macbeth - William Shakespeare    "],
  ["    A Separate Peace - John Knowles     "],
  [" Lord of the Flies - William Golding"],
  ["A Tale of Two Cities - Charles Dickens"]
]

Create a function that takes an array like the one above and transforms it into the same format as the one below:

[
  ["Death of a Salesman", "Arthur Miller"],
  ["Macbeth", "William Shakespeare"],
  ["A Separate Peace", "John Knowles"],
  ["Lord of the Flies", "William Golding"],
  ["A Tale of Two Cities", "Charles Dickens"]
]

  "     The Catcher in the Rye - J. D. Salinger    ",
  "    Brave New World - Aldous Huxley   ",

]) ➞ [
