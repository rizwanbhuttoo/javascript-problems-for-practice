Look-and-Say Sequence

Create a function that takes in two positive integers start and n and returns a list of the first n terms of the look-and-say sequence starting at the given start.

Each term of the look-and-say sequence (except for the first term) is created from the previous term using the following process.

Start with a term in the sequence (for example, 111312211):

111312211

Split it into subsequences of consecutive repeating digits:

111 3 1 22 11

Count the number of digits in each subsequence:

three 1, one 3, one 1, two 2, two 1

Turn everything into digits:

3 1, 1 3, 1 1, 2 2, 2 1

Now combine everything into one number:

3113112221

So 3113112221 is the next term in the sequence after 111312211.

Examples
lookAndSay(1, 7) ➞ [1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221]

lookAndSay(123, 4) ➞ [123, 111213, 31121113, 1321123113]

lookAndSay(70, 5) ➞ [70, 1710, 11171110, 31173110, 132117132110]
Notes

Your output should be an array of integers in the correct sequence.
