/*
Do All Bigrams Exist?

You are given an input array of bigrams, and an array of words.

Write a function that returns true if every single bigram from this array can be found at least once in an array of words.

Examples
canFind(["at", "be", "th", "au"], ["beautiful", "the", "hat"]) ➞ true

canFind(["ay", "be", "ta", "cu"], ["maybe", "beta", "abet", "course"]) ➞ false
# "cu" does not exist in any of the words.

canFind(["th", "fo", "ma", "or"], ["the", "many", "for", "forest"]) ➞ true

canFind(["oo", "mi", "ki", "la"], ["milk", "chocolate", "cooks"]) ➞ false
Notes
A bigram is string of two consecutive characters in the same word.
If the array of words is empty, return false.
