Pyramidal Strings

In this challenge, you have to obtain a pyramidal version of a given string, transforming the string into an array containing a series of string slices that progressively increase or decrease steadily from the left to the right. Every slice containing two or more characters must have a space between every pair of characters, to permit a hypothetical vertical alignment. See the example below:

// REGULAR pyramidal version of "EDABIT"

[ "E",
 "D A",
"B I T" ]

Depending on the given type, you have to obtain a regular pyramid starting from its vertex (type === "REG") as in the example above, or a reversed pyramid starting from its base (type === "REV") as in the example below:

// REVERSED pyramidal version of "EDABIT"

["E D A",
  "B I",
   "T"  ]

Every pyramid must follow the same steadily increment/decrement of its slices (or rows) by exactly one character (excluding spaces), so that not every string can be transformed in a pyramid! See the example below:

// Regular pyramidal version of "PYRAMID"

[ "P",
 "Y R",
"A M I" ]

// Letter "D" can't be placed in the pyramid

Given as parameters a string and a type, implement a function that returns:

A string "Error!" if the pyramidal version can't be obtained from the given string.
An array containing the regular pyramidal version of the string if the given type is equal to "REG".
An array containing the reversed pyramidal version of the string if the given type is equal to "REV".
Examples
pyramidalString("EDABIT", "REG") ➞ ["E", "D A", "B I T"]

pyramidalString("EDABIT", "REV") ➞ ["E D A", "B I", "T"]

pyramidalString("PYRAMID", "REG") ➞ "Error!"

pyramidalString("!", "REV") ➞ ["!"]

pyramidalString("", "REG") ➞ []
Notes
If the given string has just one character, the returned array will contain that single character. If the given string is empty, the returned array will be empty.
Remember to insert a space between every character inside the rows containing two or more characters.
The increment and the decrement of the rows in a pyramidal string are equal to one character more or less than the previous, depending on the given type.
You have to find a discriminant rule to establish if a string can be transformed into a pyramid, without creating single exceptions for every given case. What is suggesting to you the shape of a pyramid seen frontally?
