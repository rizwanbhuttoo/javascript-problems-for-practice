Radioactive Decay

A half life is the amount of time for half of a radioactive substance to decay.

After 1 half life, 50% of a substance will be left.
After 2 half lives, 25% of a substance will be left.
After 3 half lives, 12.5% of a substance will be left, etc...

Create a function which calculates the remaining mass and the number of years that it took for the substance to decay. You will be given:

The mass of the substance.
The time in years for a halflife to elapse.
The number of half lives.
Worked Example
halflifeCalculator(1000, 5730, 2) ➞ [250, 11460]

// There are 2 half lives, so the mass decays from 1000 to 500, then from 500 to 250.
// Each halflife is 5730 years, and since there were 2, it took 11460 years in total.
Examples
halflifeCalculator(1600, 6, 3) ➞ [200, 18]

halflifeCalculator(13, 500, 1) ➞ [6.5, 500]

halflifeCalculator(100, 35, 5) ➞ [3.125, 175]
Notes
Round the final mass to three decimal places.
All inputs are positive numbers.
Return the final mass first, then the number of years.
