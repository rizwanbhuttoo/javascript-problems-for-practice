Postfix Notation (Part 1: Evaluation)

Mathematical expressions are usually written with infix notation, where the operator is in-between the two operands. Postfix notation, on the other hand, is where the operator follows the operands. As we use operator precedence to determine the order of calculation (e.g. multiplication/division is evaluated before addition/subtraction), we can change the position of the operands and eliminate the need for parentheses:

2 + 5   # Infix
2 5 +   # Postfix

5 + (1 + 2) * 4 - 3   # Infix
5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -     # Postfix

Postfix expressions are evaluated by reading left-to-right. Any time an operator is reached, a calculation is performed on the previous two operands. The process repeats until there are no more calculations to perform:

2 3 4 * + 9 -   # evaluate 3x4
   2 12 + 9 -   # evaluate 2+12
       14 9 -   # evaluate 14-9
            5   # final answer

Given a postfix expression as a string, return the evaluated expression. A single space separates each operator/operand.

Examples
postfix("12 3 /") ➞ 4

postfix("5 3 4 * +") ➞ 17

postfix("5 3 + 4 *") ➞ 32
Notes

Postfix is also known as "Reverse Polish Notation". See the resources tab for more information.
