No Good Numbers

A positive number's population is the sum of 1's in its binary representation.

An evil number has an even numbered population.
An odious number has an odd numbered population.
A number is pernicious if its population is a prime number.

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a sorted array of all its descriptors ("Evil", "Odious", or "Pernicious").

Examples
howBad(7) ➞ ["Odious", "Pernicious"]
// 7 in binary is "111".
// 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 in "111" means "Odious" should be added to the array answer.
// 3 is a prime number, meaning "Pernicious" should also be added.

howBad(17) ➞ ["Evil", "Pernicious"]
// 17 in binary is "10001".
// 1 + 1 = 2 in "10001" means "Evil" should be added to the array answer.
// 2 is a prime number, meaning "Pernicious" should also be added.

howBad(23) ➞ ["Evil"]
// 23 in binary is "10111".
// Four 1's in "10111" means "Evil" should be added to the array answer.
// 4 is not a prime number, meaning "Pernicious" should not be added.
