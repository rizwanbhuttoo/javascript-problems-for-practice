Virtual DAC

In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a binary representation of that signal into an analog output. An 8 bit converter can represent a maximum of 2^8 different values, with each successive value differing by 1/256 of the full scale value, this becomes the system resolution and would be approximately 0.25% of the full range.

Create a function that takes a binary output reading and returns the analog voltage level that would create that DAC reading.

While value range is 0-1023, reference range is 0-5.00 volts. Value and reference is directly proportional.

This DAC has 10 bits of resolution and the DAC reference is at 5.00 volts.

Examples
adc(0) ➞ 0

adc(1023) ➞ 5

adc(500) ➞ 2.44

adc(400) ➞ 1.96
Notes

You should return your value rounded to two decimal places.
