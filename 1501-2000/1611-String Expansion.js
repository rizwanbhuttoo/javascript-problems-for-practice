String Expansion

Create a function which takes a string txt and expands it as per following rules:

The numeric values represent the occurrence of each letter preceding that numeric value.
stringExpansion("3M2u5b2a1s1h2i1r") ➞ "MMMuubbbbbaashiir"
The first occurrence of a numeric value should be the number of times each character behind it is repeated, until the next numeric value appears.
stringExpansion("3Mat")➞ "MMMaaattt"      // correct

stringExpansion("3Mat") ➞ "MMMat"          // wrong
stringExpansion("3Mat") ➞ "MatMatMat"      // wrong
If there are consecutive numeric characters, ignore them all except last one.
stringExpansion("3M123u42b12a") ➞ "MMMuuubbaa"
If there are two consecutive alphabetic characters then the string will remain unchanged.
stringExpansion("airforce") ➞ "airforce"
Empty strings should return an empty string.
stringExpansion("") ➞ ""
