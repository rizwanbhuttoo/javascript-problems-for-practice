Clockwise Cipher

In Clockwise Cipher, encoding is done by placing message characters in the corner cells of a square and moving in a clockwise direction.

Create a function that takes an argument message, and returns the encoded message.

There are some variations on the rules of encipherment. One version of the cipher rules are outlined below:

message = "Mubashir Hassan"

clockwiseCipher(message) ➞ "Ms ussahr nHaaib"

Step 1: Form a square large enough to fit all the message characters. Given message can fit in a 4 x 4 square.

Step 2: Starting with the top-left corner, place message characters in the corner cells moving in a clockwise direction. After the first cycle is complete, continue placing characters in the cells following the last one in its respective row/column. When the outer cells are filled, continue for the remaining inner squares:

M	s		u
s	s	a	h
r		n	H
a	a	i	b

Step 3: Return encoded message Rows-wise:

eMessage = "Ms ussahr nHaaib"
Example for a 5 x 5 Square
[ 1  5  9 13  2]
[16 17 21 18  6]
[12 24 25 22 10]
[ 8 20 23 19 14]
[ 4 15 11  7  3]
Examples
clockwiseCipher("Mubashir Hassan") ➞ "Ms ussahr nHaaib"

clockwiseCipher("Matt MacPherson") ➞ "M ParsoMc nhteat"

clockwiseCipher("Edabit is amazing") ➞ "Eisadng  tm    i   zbia a"
Notes
Fill up any unused cells with a space character.
Message can contain spaces and special characters.
