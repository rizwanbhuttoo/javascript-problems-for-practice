KixCodes in the Netherlands

In The Netherlands we have PostNL, the postal company. They use KixCodes, it's a fast way to deliver letters and packages that can be scanned during the process.

The code is a combination of: Postal code, House/box/call number and House appendage / suffix

If there is a character between the house number and the suffix, we need to replace that with an X. Eventually, the code will be printed in the KixCode font.

Examples
kixCode(`PostNL, Postbus 30250, 2500 GG ’s Gravenhage`) ➞ `2500GG30250`

kixCode(`Liesanne B Wilkens, Kogge 11-1, 1657 KA Abbekerk`) ➞ `1657KA11X1`

kixCode(`Dijk, Antwoordnummer 80430, 2130 VA Hoofddorp`) ➞ `2130VA80430`
Notes
Your function will get an address line (string) separated by comma's.
The input format will always be the same.
Watch out for the different suffixes!
