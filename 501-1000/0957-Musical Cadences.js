Musical Cadences

In music, cadences act as punctuation in musical phrases, and help to mark the end of phrases. Cadences are the two chords at the end of a phrase. The different cadences are as follows:

V followed by I is a Perfect Cadence
IV followed by I is a Plagal Cadence
V followed by Any chord other than I is an Interrupted Cadence
Any chord followed by V is an Imperfect Cadence

Create a function where given a chord progression as an array, return the type of cadence the phrase ends on.

Examples
findCadence(["I", "IV", "V"]) ➞ "imperfect"

findCadence(["ii", "V", "I"]) ➞ "perfect"

findCadence(["I", "IV", "I", "V", "vi"]) ➞ "interrupted"
Notes
Return strings all in lowercase.
Only focus on the last two chords of a progression.
Return "no cadence" if none of the criteria match up.
I is a capital i, not a lowercase L.
