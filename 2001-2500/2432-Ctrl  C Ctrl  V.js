/*
Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V

Given a sentence containing few instances of "Ctrl + C" and "Ctrl + V", return the sentence after those keyboard shortcuts have been applied! Note that:

In this case, "Ctrl + C" will copy all text behind it.
In this case, "Ctrl + V" will do nothing if there is no "Ctrl + C" before it.
A "Ctrl + C" which follows another "Ctrl + C" will overwrite what it copies.
Examples
keyboardShortcut("the egg and Ctrl + C Ctrl + V the spoon") ➞ "the egg and the egg and the spoon"

keyboardShortcut("WARNING Ctrl + V Ctrl + C Ctrl + V") ➞ "WARNING WARNING"

keyboardShortcut("The Ctrl + C Ctrl + V Town Ctrl + C Ctrl + V") ➞ "The The Town The The Town"
Notes
Keyboard shortcut commands will appear like normal words in a sentence but shouldn't be copied themselves (see example #2).
Pasting should add a space between words.
