Road Navigation

Road systems can be imagined as a graph of intersections connected by lines. The advantage of this is it makes it easier to find the shortest path between any two intersections.

Task

Write a function that takes as arguments:

A graph of the road system
The starting intersection (node)
The ending intersection (node)

And returns an object containing information about the shortest path.

Format of the road graph

The road graph follows the JSON graph specification linked in the Resources tab. As an example, this is what one road graph could look like (in JSON):

{
  "graph": {
    "directed": false,
    "nodes": [
      { "id": 0 },
      { "id": 1 },
      { "id": 2 },
       { "id": 3 }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "source": 0,
        "target": 1,
        "metadata": {
          "distance": 5
        }
      },
      {
        "source": 1,
        "target": 3,
        "metadata": {
          "distance": 9
        }
      },
      {
        "source": 3,
        "target": 2,
        "metadata": {
          "distance": 6
        }
      },
      {
        "source": 2,
        "target": 4,
        "metadata": {
          "distance": 3
        }
      },
      {
        "source": 4,
        "target": 3,
        "metadata": {
          "distance": 8
        },
      },
      {
       "source": 4,
       "target": 0,
       "metadata": {
         "distance": 2
       }
     }
    ]
  }
}

Additionally, all edges are two way roads (undirected), so you don't need to worry about that. Which node is in source and which is in target does not matter. Edges may contain the property label, which is just a street name and not necessary for you to use.

And remember, the goal is to minimize the sum of all the metadata.distance properties of edges used.

Format of return value

The return value should be an object with properties distance and path.

distance should be the number that is the total sum of the distance metadata on each edge used.

path should be an array of numbers, where each number is the id of a node used along the path from the start to the end.

For example, if the shortest path from node 1 to node id 2 was going from node 1 to node 3 to node 2, then the result should be [1, 3, 2]. You must include the starting and ending nodes in the path.

If two paths have the same distance, it does not matter which one you return (which won't happen in the tests).

Example

In the example road graph, if I asked you to find the path from node id 2 to node id 0, the function call would be

navigate(roads, 2, 0) // Where roads is the example graph structure

And you should return

{
  "distance": 5,
  "path": [ 2, 4, 0 ]
}
Notes
If two paths have the same distance, it doesn't matter which one you return (which won't happen in the tests).
Make sure to include the starting and ending nodes in the path.
The order of the path array does matter.
Distance between 2 nodes is located in the metadata.distance property of the edge connecting them.
