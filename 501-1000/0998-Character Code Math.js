/*
Character Code Math

Turn each character in a string str into its ASCII character code and join them together to create a number.

For example, for string "abc", the number is 979899. We will call this number "num1".

"abc" ➞ "a" = 97, "b" = 98, "c" = 99 ➞ 979899

Then replace any incidence of the number 7 with the number 1, and call this number "num2":

num1 = 979899

num2 = 919899

Return the difference between the sum of the digits in num1 and num2:

  (9 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 9 + 9)
- (9 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 + 9)
-------------------------
         ➞  6
Examples
calc("ABCDabcd") ➞ 12

calc("cdefgh") ➞ 0

calc("ifkhchlhfde") ➞ 6
Notes

Lowercase and uppercase characters have different ASCII character codes.
