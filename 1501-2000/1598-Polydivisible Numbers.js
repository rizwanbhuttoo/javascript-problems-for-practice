Polydivisible Numbers

Mubashir was reading about Polydivisible Numbers on Wikipedia.

In mathematics a Polydivisible Number (or magic number) is a number in a given number base with digits abcde... that has the following properties:

Its first digit a is not 0.
The number formed by its first two digits ab is a multiple of 2.
The number formed by its first three digits abc is a multiple of 3.
The number formed by its first four digits abcd is a multiple of 4.
etc.

Create a function which takes an integer n and returns true if the given number is a Polydivisible Number and false otherwise.

Examples
isPolydivisible(1232) ➞ true
// 1     / 1 = 1
// 12    / 2 = 6
// 123   / 3 = 41
// 1232  / 4 = 308

isPolydivisible(123220 ) ➞ false
// 1   / 1 = 1
// 12   / 2 = 6
// 123   / 3 = 41
// 1232   / 4 = 308
// 12322   / 5 = 2464.4         // Not a Whole Number
// 123220   /6 = 220536.333...  // Not a Whole Number
