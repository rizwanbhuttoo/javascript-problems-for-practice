Playing with Nested Objects

Create a function that takes an object and returns an object of all entries having unique marks. If the marks are the same, take who is eldest.

Examples
getObject({
  "0": { age: 18, name: "john", marks: "400" },
  "1": { age: 17, name: "julie", marks: "400" },
  "2": { age: 16, name: "Robin", marks: "200" },
  "3": { age: 16, name: "Bella", marks: "300" }
}) ➞ {
  "0": { age: 18, name: "john", marks: "400" },
  "1": { age: 16, name: "Robin", marks: "200" },
  "2": { age: 16, name: "Bella", marks: "300" }
}

getObject({
  0: {age: 18, name: 'john', marks: '400'},
  1: {age: 17, name: 'julie', marks: '400'},
  2: {age: 16, name: 'Robin', marks: '200'},
  3: {age: 16, name: 'Bella', marks: '300'},
  4: {age: 16, name: 'john', marks: '250'},
  5: {age: 15, name: 'julie', marks: '250'}
}) ➞    {
  0: {age: 18, name: 'john', marks: '400'},
  1: {age: 16, name: 'Robin', marks: '200'},
  2: {age: 16, name: 'Bella', marks: '300'},
  3: {age: 16, name: 'john', marks: '250'}
}
