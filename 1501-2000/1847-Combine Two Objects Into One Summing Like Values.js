Combine Two Objects Into One, Summing Like Values

Take two objects with similar key values and combine them into a new object summing any values that belong to the same category.

There's a married couple, Hank and his spouse Sheila. Hank works at a power plant making $70,000 a year, and Sheila is a teacher making $40,000 a year. They both earn rental income from separate rental properties, Hank will get $12,000 and Sheila $10,000. The new object will show their separate income but combine the rental income because it fits the same category.

const user1 = {
  powerPlant: 70000,
  rental: 12000
}

const user2 = {
  teaching: 40000,
  rental: 10000
}

becomes ➞ {
  powerPlant: 70000,
  teaching: 40000,
  rental: 22000   // The rental income is added together.
}
Arguments
user1Income (Object) ⁠— an income object for user1
user2Income (Object) ⁠— an income object for user2
returns: A new object with like values combined
Challenges
They won't have the same number of key-value pairs.
The return object must return the values ordered from lowest to highest so your answers can match the test answers.
