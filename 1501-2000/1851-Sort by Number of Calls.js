/*
Sort by Number of Calls

Create a function that takes a list of functions and sorts them in ascending order based on how many calls are needed for them to return a non-function.

Examples
f1 = _ => "hello"
// f1() ➞ "hello"

f2 = _ => _ => "edabit"
// f2()() ➞ "edabit"

f3 = _ => _ => _ => "user"
// f3()()() ➞ "user"

funcSort([f2, f3, f1]) ➞ [f1, f2, f3]
// [f2, f3, f1] ➞ [2, 3, 1] ➞ [1, 2, 3] ➞ [f1, f2, f3]

funcSort([f1, f2, f3]) ➞ [f1, f2, f3]
// [f1, f2, f3] ➞ [1, 2, 3] ➞ [1, 2, 3] ➞ [f1, f2, f3]

funcSort([f2, "func"]) ➞ ["func", f2]
// [f2, "func"] ➞ [2, 0] ➞ [0, 2] ➞ ["func", f2]
Notes
Treat non-functions as needing zero calls.
Every function will be called with empty parameters.
Every function will need to be called at least once.
The potentially returned values include Numbers, Booleans, and Strings, among others.
