Learn Lodash: matchesProperty, Check if an Object Contains a Key Value Pair

Write your own version of the lodash _.matchesProperty function using vanilla JavaScript. matchesProperty returns a function that that compares the given object and a path, which is a key-value pair, then determines if the object includes the pair.

For instance, when using the regular JavaScript find method you would write it like so:

arrayOfCars.find(car => car.year === 2020)

Because the matchesProperty function returns a function it can be used to replace the callback function written in the find method. Using matchesProperty it could look like this:

arrayOfCars.find(matchesProperty("year", 2020))

This is a helper function that is often used by other more advanced lodash functions that want to check for a match. As we write more lodash functions we will need this helper.

This is very similar to the matches function. The only difference is the way the arguments are passed in, matches requires an object, matchesProperty requires two strings representing a key value pair.

Arguments
path (Array or String): The path key-value pair you are using to see if it is included in the object.
returns: A new function.
Examples
const objects = [
  { "a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3 },
  { "a": 4, "b": 5, "c": 6 }
]
_.find(objects, _.matchesProperty("a", 4))
➞ [{ "a": 4, "b": 5, "c": 6 }]
Notes
Do not attempt to import lodash; you are simply writing your own version.
